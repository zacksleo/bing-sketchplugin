# Bing Data Plugin

## Installation

The plugin comes bundled with Sketch 52, but if for some reason you’ve lost it, you can [download it from the releases page](https://github.com/zacksleo/bing-sketchplugin/releases/latest).

## Features

Get images from Bing, using Sketch 52’s new Data Supplier feature.

You can use it from the toolbar Data icon…

…or from the contextual menu for any layer…

…or even for Overrides using the Inspector:

When you’ve set an image fill for a layer, you can later on open the original URL for an image, in case you need to full credits, or download the original file, etc. To do that, click Plugins › Unsplash › View Photo on Unsplash. It does not work for overrides yet, but we’re working on it!
